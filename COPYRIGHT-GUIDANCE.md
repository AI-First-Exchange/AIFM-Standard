# COPYRIGHT & HUMAN AUTHORSHIP GUIDANCE

The AI Format Foundation recognizes that copyright protection for AI-assisted works requires meaningful human creative contribution. The standards in this repository (AIM, AIV, AII, AIP) support documentation of human authorship through structured metadata, provenance, and workflow history.

## 1. Human Authorship Requirements

A work may be eligible for copyright if a human:
- Writes prompts or textual instructions
- Directs style, tone, structure, or sequencing
- Curates, selects, or rejects generated outputs
- Edits, modifies, or enhances the output
- Provides creative inputs that shape the final work

Purely autonomous AI output without human creative influence is not copyrightable.

## 2. How This Standard Supports Copyright Claims

This format includes metadata to document:
- Creator identity (name, handle, email)
- Human-authored prompts and scripts
- Editing steps and final decisions
- Toolchain and model information
- Timestamps and provenance

This information may be used to demonstrate human involvement in the creative process.

## 3. Recommended Manifest Fields for Legal Compliance

Creators may include these optional fields:

"human_authorship_statement": "I affirm that I contributed creative authorship...",
"human_signature": "Name or digital signature hash",
"creator_email": "email@example.com",
"editorial_notes": "Summary of human creative decisions."

## 4. Ownership

Copyright belongs to the human author(s) who contributed creative expression.  
If the work contains only machine-generated expression, it may not qualify for protection.

## 5. Licensing

Creators may include licensing files in `legal/license.txt` and `legal/terms.txt`.  
All distribution must follow applicable legal requirements.
